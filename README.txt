There are two versions of the Harris Elemental Model: one with connections between CS-US and a 
fully connected model.

The Python code for each simulator are ‘HarrisElementalModel.py’ and ‘HarrisElementalModelFull.py’. 
The Python libraries used are numpy, re, random, copy, matplotlib, tkinter, xlsxwriter, itertools, 
PIL and time. Make sure these libraries are installed on the machine, if the code is to be run on Python. 
The version of Python used is 3.6.

The ‘experiments’ folder contains ‘.hrs’ files for various experiments that were run during the experiment.
They can be loaded into either simulator.
