There are two versions of the Harris Elemental Model: one with connections between CS-US and a 
fully connected model.

The Python code for each simulator are ‘HarrisElementalModel.py’ and ‘HarrisElementalModelFull.py’. 
The Python libraries used are numpy, re, random, copy, matplotlib, tkinter, xlsxwriter, itertools, 
PIL and time. Make sure these libraries are installed on the machine, if the code is to be run on Python. 
The version of Python used is 3.6.

The ‘experiments’ folder contains ‘.hrs’ files for each experiment. They are numbered in the same order 
as the experiments completed in this project. They can be loaded into either simulator.
Files have been submitted to the Programmes Office on two USBs and on moodle.
